          <h1>About Jack.</h1>
          <p>
            Hello. My name is Jack Forge and I am an Indigenous Web Developer
            from Canada. My main focus has been on writing code for the
            Front-End in order to create beautifully designed websites (or at
            least I try). I have worked with HTML, CSS, and am in the process of
            learning JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I am fairly new to coding, it has absorbed my life and left me
            wanting to learn as much as I can. I wake up every single day at 4
            AM to code before going to my day job, and then try to code at night
            before going to bed. My days are long and I hardly get any sleep,
            but overall I feel it is worth it to constantly improve.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the moment I am mainly focused on freelancing. Creating websites
            for small locally owned businesses trying to increase their web
            presence. I am always surprised at how many small business owners
            want a website but are intimidated by reaching out to someone to
            create one for them. My goal is to make that process as easy as
            possible for them.
          </p>

          <p>
            My long-term goal in becoming a web developer is to increase the
            visibility of Indigenous Canadians in Tech. There are some very
            talented Indigenous men and women in the industry, but sadly not
            nearly enough as their should be. If I can inspire more to look
            towards tech as a career then I will consider this whole endeavour
            into web development to be a success.
          </p>

          <p>
            So that's me. I'm Jack Forge. If you would like to talk, visit the
